**The Movie Journal**

This is a project to save and keep track of the movies I have watched with a rating and a comment. The project is being created for personal use, both as a hobby and to practace my developing skills.

The goals for the project are:
- A synchronized database with all added movie-entries
- A web-based application for computers
- An app for mobile use
